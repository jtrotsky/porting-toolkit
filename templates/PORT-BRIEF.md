# PORT-BRIEF — <app>

Completed Phase 0/1 port plan (researched <date> by a stronger-context session;
facts below are verified from upstream unless marked VERIFY). Per the skill's
execution-discipline rules: trust these facts, re-verify only that the pinned
tag is still the latest release, skip the research subagent, start at Phase 2.

## Mission
Build the FreeBSD daemonless image for **<upstream URL>** and open the PR.
Nothing else: <explicitly fence out-of-scope work — deployment, proxy wiring,
upstream feature requests>.

## Verified facts
- **Pin:** `<tag>` (latest release as of <date> — re-verify on the releases
  page before scaffolding).
- **License:** <license>.
- **Layout:** <where package.json / go.mod / pyproject lives; monorepo notes>.
- **Runtime:** <runtime + version, and how upstream's own Dockerfile runs it>.
- **Build:** `<build commands>`. **Start:** `<start command>`.
- **Dependencies:** <every native/compiled dep with its FreeBSD status, or
  "all pure JS/Go/py — no natives". If natives exist, map each to its cookbook
  entry here.>
- **Config (env):** <required and optional env vars with defaults>.

## Crib (mandatory — do not tour the registry)
- **Copy from `<nearest twin image>`:** `Containerfile.j2` structure,
  `root/etc/services.d/<app>/run`, `.daemonless/config.yaml` shape.
- <one line on what differs from the twin and must NOT be copied>.

## Functional probe (mandatory — proves it WORKS, not just boots)
- CIT health: <path + expected status, and why (e.g. real /health pings an
  external dep and 503s in isolation → use / for CIT)>.
- Smoke test (`scripts/smoke-test.sh`): <one concrete request that exercises
  the app's actual purpose, and the expected response — e.g. "GET /share/x
  returns the app's own 404 page (proves routing + render), not a connection
  error">.

## Decisions already made
- **Base image:** <base vs base-core, tag, per the skill's ABI rule>.
- **CIT mode:** <health/port/command + `cit.ready:` line if the app's startup
  log matches no default pattern>.
- <any other pre-made call: volumes, user, ports>.

## Expected traps (pre-mapped to cookbook entries)
1. <trap → cookbook entry title>.
2. <...>

## Definition of done
Per the skill: clean `scripts/build.sh` + CIT pass + smoke test + guards +
port-auditor CLEAN + BUILD-NOTES.md + PROCESS-LOG.md + lint-compose pass + PR
(with provenance + viva sections) from a branch off upstream/main + any new
cookbook entries appended. Then STOP for human review.
