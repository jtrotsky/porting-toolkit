# The ONLY sanctioned way to build. Wraps `dbuild build` with:
#   - a staleness gate: refuses to run if Containerfile.j2 is newer than Containerfile
#     (edit .j2 → `dbuild generate` → build; never build a stale Containerfile)
#   - full log capture to build.log
#   - real-error detection: dbuild's wrapper can exit 0 while the inner build failed,
#     so the log is grepped for the known failure signatures automatically
#
# MUST run in the background (Claude Code Bash: run_in_background: true). A cold
# FreeBSD build (pkg install + npm ci + compile + ZFS layer commits) routinely
# outlives the foreground tool timeout, which SIGKILLs it (exit 137) and can kill
# the whole session (2026-07-04). The enforce-background-build hook blocks
# foreground invocations.
#
# Usage: scripts/build.sh [dbuild build args, e.g. --variant TAG]
